it would see infinite numbers: for a unit, as it were, all number.
God knowing the fruitfulness of his own virtue, knows a numberless

more capacious than this; and -having created an inconceivable
number, he knows he could still create more: so that he beholds in-
iinite worlds, infinite numbers of men, and other creatures in him-

those kinds, even as many as he can create, if his will did order and

A comprehensive knowledge of his own power doth necessarily in-

God could not understand more than he hath created, he could not
create more than he hath created: for it cannot be conceived how
he can create anything that he is ignorant of; what he doth not

3. It is further evident that God knows all possible things, because
he knew those things which he has created, before they were created,
when they were yet in a possibility. If God knew things before they
were created, he knew them when they were in a possibility, and not
in actual reality. It is absurd to imagine that his understanding did
laekey after the creatures, and draw knowledge from them aiter they
were created. It is absurd to think that God did create, before he
knew what he could or would create. If he knew those things he
did create when they were possible, he must know all things which
he can create, and therefore all things that are possible. To conclude
this, we must consider that this knowled e is of another kind than
his knowledge of things that are or shall  He sees possible things
as possible, not as things that ever are or shall be. It he saw them
as existing or future, and they shall never be, this knowledge would
be false, there would be a deceit in it, which cannot be. He knows
those things not in themselves, because they are not, nor in their
causes, because they shall never be; he knows them in his own
power, not in his will: he understands them as able to produce
them, not as willing to etfect them. Things powible he knows only
in hispower; things future he knows both in his power and his
