holy purpose, and hide other things from them which are not so con-
ducing to his gracious ends, which would be as much the occasions
of exciting their sin, as the others which he doth bring forth to their
view? The Jews, at the time of Christ, were of a turbulent and
seditious humor; they expected a Messiah, a temp<;al king, and
would readily have embraced any occasion to have n up in arms
to have delivered themselves from the Roman yoke; to this purpose
the people attempted once to make him king: and proba ly the
expectation they ad that he had such a design to head them, might
be one reason of their “hosannas;” because without some such con-
ceit it was not probable they should so soon change their note, and
vote him to the cross in so short a time, after they had applauded
him as if he had been u n a throne; but their being de eated of
strong expectations, usually) ended” in a more ardent   This tur-
bulent an seditious humor God directs in another channel, suppres-
seth all occurrences that might excit/e them to a rebellion against the
Romans, which, if he had given way to, the crucifying Christ, which:
was God’s design to bring about at that time, had not robably been
efected, and the salvation of mankind been hindered) or stood at a
stay for a time. God, therefore, orders such objects and occasions,
that might direct this seditious humor to another channel, which
would else have run out in other actions, which had not been conduc-
ing to the at design he had then in the world. Is it not the right
of God, and-[without any blemish to his holiness, to use those corrup-
tions which he finds sown in the nature of his creature by the hand
of Satan, and to propose such objects as may excite the exercise of
them for his own service? Sure God hath as much right to serve
himself of the creature of his own framin , and what natures soever
they are possessed with, and to present ofhects to that purpose, as a
falconer hath to offer this or that bird to his hawk to exercise his
courage, and excite his ravenousness, without being termed the author
of that ravenousness in the creature. God planted not those corrup-
tions in the Jews, but finds them in those persons over whom he
hath an absolute sovereignty in the right of a Creator, and that of a
Judge for their sins: and by the right of that sovereignty may offer
such objects and occasions, which, though innocent in themselves,
he knows the will make use of to ill purposes, but which by the
same decree that he resolves to present such occasions to them, he
also resolves to make use of them for his own glory. It is not con-
ceivable by us what way that death of Christ, which was necessary
for the satisfaction of Divine justice, could be brought about without
ordering the evil of some men’s hearts b special occasions to effect
his purplose; We cannot sup ose that Christ can be guilty of any
crime t at deserved death gy the Jewish law; had he been so a
criminal, he could not have been a Redeemer: a perfect innocence
was necessar to the design of his coming.” Had God himself put
him to that dreath, without using instruments of wickedness in it, by
some remarkable hand from heaven, the innocence of his nature had
been forever eclipsed, and the voluntariness of his sacrifice ,had been
obscured: the strangeness of such a judgment would have made his
