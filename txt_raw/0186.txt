fewer thoughts we have of him than of antylthing else; in the greedy
pursuit of the world; in the strong addicte ess to sensual pleasures,
m paying a service, upon an success in the world, to instruments
more than to God: this is a debasing God in setting up a creature,
but more in settin u a base lust; it is a den ing of God. Man
would make himself tlxie end of all creatures. in plride; using the
creatures contrary to the end God hath aépipointedz t is is to dishonor
God, and it is diabolical. Man would m e himself the end of God;
in loving God, because of some self- leasing benefits distributed by
him; in abstinence from some sins, gecause they are ainst the in-
terest of some other beloved corruption; in performingaduties merely
for a selfish interest, which is evident in unwieldiness in religious
duties, where self is not concerned; in calling upon God only in a
time of necessity; in begging his assistance to our own projects aiier
we have by our own craft, laid the plot; in impatience upon a refusal
of our desires; in selfish aims we have in our duties: this is a vilify-
ing God., a dethroning him; in unworthy imaginations of God, uni~
versal in man by nature. Hence spring idolatry, superstition, pre-
sumption, the common disease of the world. This is a vilifying God;
worse than idolatry, worse than absolute atheism. Natural desires
to be distant from him; no desires for the remembrance of him; no
desires of converse with him; no desires of a thorough return to
him; no desire of any close imitation of him.
