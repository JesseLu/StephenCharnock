22 PREFACE.
work, where he not only brings down the highest doctrines to the lowest ca-
pacities, but collects great variety of proper, pertinent, useful, and yet, many
times, unthought-of inferences, and that from those truths, which however they
atford much matter for inquisition and speculation, yet might seem, unless to
the most intelligent and judicious Christians, to have a more remote influence
upon practice. 'He is not like some school writers, who attenuate and rarefy
the matter they discourse of to a degree bordering upon annihilation, at least,
beat it so thin, that a puff of breath may blow it away; spin their thread so
fine, that the cloth, when made up, proves useless, solidity dwindlm into nice
ties, and what we thought we had got by their assertions, we lose by their dis-
tinctions. But if our author have some subtilties and superfine notions in his
argumentations, yet he condenseth them again, and consolidates them into
substantial and profitable corollaries in his applications; and in them his main
business is, as to discipline a profane world for its neglect of God, and contempt
of him in his most adorable and shining perfections, so likewise to show how
the Divine Attributes are not only infinitely excellent in themselves, but a
grand foundation for all t.rue divine worship, and should be the great motives
to provoke men to the exercise of faith, and love, and fear, and humility, and
all that holy obedience they are called to by the gospel; and this, without
peradventure, is the great end of all those rich discoveries God hath in his
word made of himself to us. And, reader, if these elaborate discourses of this
holy man, through the Lordâ€™s blessing, become a means of promoting holiness
in thee, and stir thee up to love and live to the God of his praise (Ps. cix. 1),
we are well assured that his end in preaching them is answered, and so is oun
in publishing them.
Thine in the Lord,
