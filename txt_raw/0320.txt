eternal, he hath right to a perpetual service: as service is a debt of
justice upon the account of t e excellency of his nature, so a per-
petual service is as much a debt of justice upon the account of his
eternity. If God be infinite and eternal, he merits an honor and
comportment from his creatures, suited to the unlimited perfection
of his nature, and the duration of his bein . How worthy is the
Psalmisfs resolution! “I will sing unto the Iiord as long as I live;
I will sing praise to my God while I have any being” (Ps. civ. 33).
It is the use he makes of the endless duration of the lory of God;
and will extend to all other service as well as praise. gb serve other
things, or to serve ourselves, is too vast a service upon that which is
nothing. In devoting ourselves to God, we serve him that is, that
Was, so as that he never began; is to come, so as that he never
shall end; b whom all things are what they are; who hath both
eteriilala knowledge to remember our service, and eternal goodness to
rew it.
