versed so imanimonsly, by the vote of the rulers as well as the rout,
rejected? It was impossible to conquer minds possessed with so
many errors, and a plauding themselves in their own reason, and to
render them capable of receiving revealed truths without the influ-
ence of a Divine power.
(2.) It was contrary to the customs of the world. The strength
of custom in most men, surmounts the strength of reason, and men
commonly are so wedded to it, that they will he sooner divorced
from anything than the modes and patterns received from their an-
cestors. The endeavoring to change customs of an ancient stand-
ing, hath begotten tumults and furious mutinies among nations,
though the change would have been much for their advantage. This
doctrine struck at the root of the religion of the world, and the cere-
monies, wherein they had been educated from their infancy, de-
livered to them from their ancestors, confirmed by the customary
observance of many ages, rooted in their minds and established by
their laws (Acts xviii. 13); “ This fellow persuadeth us to worshi
God contrary to the law ;” against customs, to which they ascribed
the happiness of their states, and the prosperity of their eople, and
would put, in the place of this religion t ey would abolish, a new
one instituted by a man, whom the Jews had condemned, and put
to death upon a, cross, as an impostor, hlasphemer, and seditious
person. It was a doctrine that would change the customs of the
ews, who were intrusted with the oracles of God. It would bury
forever their ceremonial rites, delivered to them by Moses, from that
God., who had, with a mighty hand, brought them out of E pt,
cowrated their law with thunders and lightnings from higunt
Sinai, at the time of its publication, backed it with severe sanctions,
confirmed it by many miracles, both in the wilderness and their
Canaan, and had continued it for so many hundred years. They
could not but remember how they had been ravaged by other na-
tions, and jnd ents sent upon them when they neglected and
slighted it; andm with what great success they were followed when
they valued and observed it; and how they had abhorred the Author
of this new religion, who had spoken sli htly of their traditions, till
they put him to death with infamy. gVVas it an egy matter to
divorce them from that worship, upon which were en ` ed, as they
imagined, their peace, lent , and glory, thin of the dearest re-
gard with mankind? The lews were no less dzvoted to their cere-~
monial traditions than the heathen were to their vain superstitious.
This doctrine of the gospel was of that nature, that the state of re-
ligion, all over the earth, must be overturned by it; the wisdom of
the Greeks must vail to it, the idolatry of the ulpeople must stoop to
lt, and the profane customs of men must mo der under the weight
of it Was it an easy matter for the pride of nature to deny a cus-
tomary wisdom, to entertain a new doctrine aglainst the authoritv of
their ancestors, to inscribe folly u on that w ich hath made them
admired by the rest of the world? Nothing can be of greater
wteein with men, than the credit of their lawgivers and founders,
the religion of their fathers, and rosperity of themselves: hence
the minds >f men were sharpened against it. The Greeks, the
