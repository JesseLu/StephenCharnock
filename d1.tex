\section{On the existence of God}
\Q{Psalm 14:1}
    {The fool has said in his heart,\\
    ``There is no God,''\\
    They are corrupt, \\
    They have done abominable works, \\
    There is none who does good.}
\BI Romans 3:9 applies this text to both Gentiles and Jews
    by quoting Psalm 14:1-3 in Romans 3:10-12.
\I  The Psalmist talks about the corruption of the atheist's soul,
    and then the corruption of his practice.  \EI

\subsection{\emph{The fool}}
\BI A wicked man.
\I  Root of Hebrew word signifies the extinction of life
    in men, animals and plants.
\I  A fool has lost wisdom, a right notion of God.
\I  He is dead in sin. \EI

\subsection{\emph{Said in his heart}}
\BI Thinks in himself.
    \Q{Psalm 10:11,13}
    {He has said in his heart, \\
    ``God has forgotten; \\
    He hides His face; \\
    He will never see.'' \\
    \ldots \\
    Why do the wicked renounce God? \\
    He has said in his heart, \\
    ``You will not require an account.''}

\I  Cannot eliminate all thoughts of God, but seeks to. \EI

\subsection{\emph{``There is no God''}}
\BI Hebrew word used for God is \emph{Eloahia},
    the providence of God, God as judge.
\I  Denies not God's existence but His providence.
\I  Three classes of atheism:
    \BI denying God's existence,
    \I  denying God's providence (or His working in this world), and 
    \I  denying God's nature (or character). \EI
\I  Denying His providence \emph{is} denying His existence
    because it is a denying of His glory.
\I  They do this so that they may be free to sin. \EI

\subsection{\emph{They are corrupt, they have done abominable works,
            there is none who does good}}
\BI The denier of God is in singular (\emph{the} fool),
    but those who are corrupt are in plural.
\I  Points to a widespread, secret atheism in all men.
\I  A partial atheism is the source of all evil and sin.
    \BI God is the source of purity, when He is denied,
        men inevitably become polluted in soul and body. \EI
\I  No man is exempt from this kind of atheism.
    \Q{Titus 1:16}
    {They profess to know God, but in words they deny Him,
    being abominable, disobedient, and disqualified for 
    every good work.}
\EI
